# Ignored tasks

This directory contains tasks that used to be part of the Ropes base image, but are removed from Ada's ropes curriculum for one or more reasons.

* Both share image stories (11 & 12) are ignored because the content taught and practiced are not as commonly used as the other core issues. No new Rails knowledge other than mailer is excercised in these two stories.

* Add style (5) is ignored because it takes an variable amount of time to complete and knowledge of BEM conventions can be quickly taught when needed.
