#### As a user I want to save a link to an image.

__Acceptance criteria__:
- [ ] The link is entered through a form.
- [ ] After the form is saved, the link is persisted in the database.
- [ ] After the form is submitted, the user is redirected to a page displaying
  the image.

__Dependencies__:
- Deployment Environment

__Note__: Many image sharing sites will permit one to upload images, or
download images when provided a link. For this project we will only work with
the link, i.e., URL, to various images.
