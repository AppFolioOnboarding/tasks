#### As a user, I want my save image submission form in a modal.

__Story__:

Now that we are displaying images for users and allowing them to submit on the same page, our website has become a bit
crowded. In order to fix this problem, User Experience (UX) has suggested we move the submission form into a modal to
clean up the page. In order to solve this, we will use `reactstrap`.

__Acceptance criteria__:
- [ ] Ran the command `yarn install reactstrap` in their project.
- [ ] The landing page shows a link to open the submission form.
- [ ] Use Reactstrap for your modal.
- [ ] Submission form is now in a modal.
- [ ] I cannot successfully save an image with an invalid URL on the front-end.
- [ ] I cannot successfully save an image with an invalid URL on the backend.
- [ ] An error message is associated with the appropriate input field on
  failure.
- [ ] The successfully saved image is displayed on the landing page.

__Dependencies__:
- Save Image Link Part 2
