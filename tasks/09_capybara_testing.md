title: Capybara Testing

#### As a developer I want to use capybara to test complete flows in my application.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] I have added a test for the "add a new image" flow.
- [ ] I have added a test for the "delete an existing image" flow.
- [ ] Any additional flows I've added to my application before this story are
  tested.

Discussion topics:
- [ ] What can you test in flow tests that you cannot test in controller tests?
- [ ] Going forward, when should we add flow tests?
- [ ] What are the tradeoffs between different drivers for capybara?
- [ ] How can Capybara help us with timing issues in our tests?
- [ ] How can we keep our tests DRY?
