#### As a user I want to add tags to images.

__Acceptance criteria__:
- [ ] When I add a new image, there is a form field to add tags.
- [ ] After I've saved an image with tags, I see those tags displayed with the
  associated image.
- [ ] My application uses the acts-as-taggable-on gem to provide the tagging
  functionality.
