#### As a user I want to see a visually pleasing application.

__Story__:

Our web application is really starting taking shape. We have added a few
features that provide value to our customers, but some of our customers are
complaining that the website is a quite bland. It is time to spice it up by
applying a visually appealing, and easy to maintain user interface to our web
application.

__Acceptance criteria__:
- [ ] The application has a header with navigation
- [ ] Images are displayed in an aesthetically pleasing list of cards
- [ ] Form errors are shown inline with the related input field
- [ ] I know how to use Bootstrap components like buttons and navbars in my
  application.
- [ ] I know the very basics of CSS and SCSS
- [ ] My SCSS files are properly named and organized using BEM convention
- [ ] My app has a "sticky" footer.
- [ ] My app has a few customized styles using bootstrap variable overrides.
- [ ] My app is responsive and is usable on a phone.
- [ ] The active link in the navigation header is differentiated.
- [ ] I use a bootstrap "container" to center my app contents (not necessarily "fluid").
- [ ] My app uses `reactstrap` components where appropriate.
