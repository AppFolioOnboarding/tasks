title: Add Feedback Form

---

#### As a developer I want to be able to get prompt feedback for the application I have developed.

__Story__:

Now that we have some familiarity with the React setup, it’s time to add the form that users will interact with!

Happy coding!


__Acceptance criteria__:
- [ ] There is a new FeedbackForm React component that contains the form
- [ ] There is an input field labeled “Your Name” to allow users to specify their name as text
- [ ] There is a text area field labeled “Comments” to allow users to specify their feedback
- [ ] There should be a submit button
- [ ] The state of the form (name, comments) is stored in a MobX state store named FeedbackStore

__Discussion Topics__:
- [ ] What is the difference between an observer and an observable in MobX?
