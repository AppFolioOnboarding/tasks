title: ES6 Configuration
---

#### As a developer I want to use the latest and greatest javascript features, including ES6 modules, in my application.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] I can develop using ES6 modules and they will be transpiled to supported
  syntax.
- [ ] I have configured my production setup to support this transpilation.
- [ ] A "hello world" ES6 module has been added to the application.
- [ ] I know how to include javascript modules only on a given page, as 
  demonstrated by only including this "hello world" module on the images index.

Discussion topics:
- [ ] What are the benefits of using ES6 modules?
- [ ] What is transpilation and why is it awesome?
